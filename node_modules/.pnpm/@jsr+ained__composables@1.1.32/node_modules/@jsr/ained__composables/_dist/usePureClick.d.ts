 * ## usePureClick
 * Handles mouse and touch events to ensure a "pure" click without drag movement, 
 * triggering the provided click handler only when there is minimal movement between 
 * `mousedown`/`touchstart` and `mouseup`/`touchend`.
 * 
 * This utility is useful for distinguishing between clicks and drag actions, 
 * where a slight movement is ignored to ensure it's a true click.
 * 
 * ```ts
 * usePureClick(container, (event) => {
 *     console.log('Pure click detected');
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * @param container The HTML element that will listen for the mouse and touch events.
 * @param click The callback function that is triggered on a pure click (minimal movement).
 * 
 * @return void
